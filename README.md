# VISM

## What is VISM?

For HowdyHack 2021, we created Visually Impaired Sheet Music (or VISM for short): our original Git for the competition can be found [here](https://github.com/josefmun9902/VISM). That version was never meant to really be used, as it was hard-coded to work on our individual computers. With that said, we did have a desire to properly deploy the application, which is what this is.

In short, I am (slowly) working to deploy the VISM application using cloud technologies, while staying up-to-date with the most current version of MuseScore. With a little bit of luck, we may be able to use it to actually help the visually impaired transcribe their sheet music.
